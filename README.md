✅ To-Do List Web Application

Tech Stack: Python, Django, SQLite, HTML/CSS, Bootstrap

Description:
Developed a user-authenticated To-Do List web application using Django, allowing users to register, log in, and manage personal tasks. Each user can create, update, mark as complete, and delete their own to-do items. Implemented authentication, authorization, and database relationships using Django’s built-in user model and views.

Key Features & Concepts Used:
 => User Registration & Login (Django Authentication System)
 => CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for tasks
 => User-specific task filtering using ForeignKey relationships
 => @login_required decorators for access control
 => Model-View-Template (MVT) architecture
 => Form handling and validation
 => Session management and CSRF protection
